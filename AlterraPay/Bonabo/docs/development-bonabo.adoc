== Resolve Conflict & Merge Step

Do:

. Checkout to your branch
. Create and checkout to new conflict branch for conflict resolve
. Fetch the origin destination branch you have conflict with
. Merge destination branch with `git merge <origin/destination_branch> —no-commit —no-ff`
. Fix conflict.
 .. Use whatever tools you have.
I'm using MELD.
 .. http://meldmerge.org/
 .. https://gist.github.com/p1nox/6102015
. RUN TEST AND MAKE SURE IT PASS
. If dont : Embrace error and find why, this is your branch
 .. Ask other team members
 .. Commit your changes, and give a clear message
. Push your conflict branch
. Do Pull Request to your destination branch
. Please check you origin Pull Request, should be closed after your successfully merge conflict branch to destination branch

Dont:

. Never resolve conflict from github page.
. Never resolve conflict to your own branch.

== Development Step

Dont:

. Create branch from "`development`" branch.
. Unrelated branch naming.
. Unclear commit message.
. Mix task into single task branch.

Do:

. Create new branch with name **+++<pivotal_type>+++/+++<PivotalID>+++-+++<Pivotal_Title>+++** (i.e : feature_159485500_avoid_deadloack, bug_159815016_backup_level) from latest branch pre-release+++</Pivotal_Title>++++++</PivotalID>++++++</pivotal_type>+++
. Start Pivotal Story
. Push the branch with commit message **[FINISH#+++<PivotalID>+++] +++<PivotalTitle>+++** to Finish the story+++</PivotalTitle>++++++</PivotalID>+++
. Create Pull Request to branch *development*
. If conflict then do Resolve Conflict Merge Instruction Above
. Accept Pull Request with message **[DELIVER#+++<PivotalID>+++] +++<PivotalTitle>+++**+++</PivotalTitle>++++++</PivotalID>+++
. Check the Travis Result on https://travis-ci.com/sepulsa/+++<repo_name>++++++</repo_name>+++
