== Pre Install

I'm using Ubuntu as development and Debian on production.
You need to install this package.

`sudo apt install build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev python-dev python3-dev libmysqlclient-dev`

Sometime you need to change `libmysqlclient-dev` to `default-libmysqlclient-dev`

== Install

. I recommended to setup this app within https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/ . Clone this repo and install dependencies using `pip`

  > pip install -r requirements.txt

. Prepare your database with empty table and run migration

  > orator migrate --seed -c orator.yaml
